# Landing Page Project

This project main goal is to create a web page from a design provided by The Odin Project (TOP). By using all the skill I learned before about css and flexbox layout, I will try to create a web page close enough to the design and maybe I will edit it later to change the styles, some text and images and make it "my design". For now I will try to match the design first.
